title: "Package listing"
---
The GAP website has a list of [packages distributed with GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html).
This page is a list of GAP packages which are **not distributed with GAP**.

There are many fine reasons why a package may not be distributed with GAP:
It may be in early development, it may never have been intended for
wider redistribution, its authors just didn't feel like, or whatever else.

This list is only occasional updated and may be out of date. We also do not
claim that it is complete in any sense. **If you are aware of any GAP package
websites or repositories not listed below, then feel free to [create a new
pull a request](https://github.com/gap-packages/gap-packages.github.io/pulls)
to add them here.**
